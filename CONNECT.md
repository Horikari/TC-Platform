# TestConnect – 3rd Party Instrument & Integration Adapters

**TestConnect** is the integration and adapter layer of the TC-Platform.  
Its purpose is to enable seamless connection of 3rd party instruments, sensors, controllers, and environmental systems to the TC ecosystem – regardless of protocol, interface, or manufacturer.

---

## What does TestConnect cover?

- **Instrument adapters:**  
  Hardware or software modules that allow connecting 3rd party instruments (e.g., power supplies, DMMs, signal generators, climate chambers, etc.) to the TC-Platform.
- **Protocol bridges:**  
  Drivers and middleware for non-VISA instruments (e.g., Modbus, MQTT, REST, USB, proprietary protocols).
- **Cable breakout & pin mapping:**  
  Schematics, pinouts, and mechanical adapters for connecting instruments with custom or non-standard connectors.
- **Environmental integration:**  
  Connecting building management systems (BMS), Home Assistant, or other sources of environmental data (temperature, humidity, etc.).
- **Driver library:**  
  Open source drivers for instruments that are not natively supported by PyVISA or standard interfaces.

## Example Integrations

- **Modbus TCP/RTU instrument integration** (e.g., industrial power meters, PLCs)
- **MQTT/REST API sensors** (IoT devices, smart relays, cloud-based measurement)
- **USB-to-serial adapters** for legacy instruments
- **Custom cable pinout documentation** for specific instrument models
- **Home Assistant or BMS data bridge** for environmental parameters
- **Python driver for a proprietary instrument** (if no VISA/SCPI support)

## Contribution Guidelines

- Share your adapter schematics, pinouts, or driver code as a pull request or issue.
- Document the supported instrument, protocol, and integration steps.
- If you have a working integration, add a usage example or test script.
