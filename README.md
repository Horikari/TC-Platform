# TC-Platform – Open Modular Test Ecosystem

**TC-Platform** is an open-source, modular test ecosystem built on three main pillars:  
**TestComposer** (software control), **TestCombiner** (modular instrument hardware), and **TestCube** (expandable fixture and plugin system).  
The goal is to provide a flexible, extensible, community-driven test solution for labs, developers, and manufacturers.

---

## Main Pillars

- [TestComposer](https://github.com/Horikari/TestComposer)  
  Software control, sequencing, GUI, automation, reporting.
- [TestCombiner](https://github.com/Horikari/TestCombiner)  
  Modular, extensible instrument hardware, firmware, protocols.
- [TestCube](https://github.com/Horikari/TestCube)  
  Expandable, cable-free fixture system, plugin modules, RPi integration.

---

## 3rd Party Integrations (Connect)

TC-Platform can be easily integrated with external systems, such as:
- Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.) – e.g., Home Assistant, KNX, Modbus, BACnet, etc.
- InfluxDB, Grafana – centralized data collection, reporting, dashboards.
- Other lab and manufacturing systems, adapters, plugins.
